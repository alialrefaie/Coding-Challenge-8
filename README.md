# Simple Event Registration Portal

This project involves creating a simple event registration portal using HTML and JavaScript. This registration portal will allow users to register for an event, select ad ate, and submit their preferences with details displayed on the page.

## Tasks
- Create HTML file named `index.html`. This file will host the structure of the event registration form and link to the JavaScript file.
- Within the HTML file, create a `<form>` element that includes a text input for the registrant's name, a text input for the registrant's email address, a dropdown selection for the registrant to choose an event date, a checkbox group for selecting preferences, and a submit button to finalize registration. Also add a `<div>` element below the form where registration details will dispaly after forms are submitted.
- Create JavaScript file named `script.js` and write this script to prevent the default form submission action to keep the page from reloading, validate that all fields are filled out and if a field is empty, an alert is displayed, and append the registration details to the display area upon successful form submission.
- Upon forms being submitted, create dynamic elements within the display area to show the registrant's name, email, selected event date, and preferences.
